API processing: Ran into difficulities because the API randomly would have it's data.list with a capital and lowercase l... didn't realize it for awhile which took up a lot of time. Other than that, not really any trouble ran into.

Displaying Output: Picked some statistics that I thought were important and provided the information in a minimalistic design.
